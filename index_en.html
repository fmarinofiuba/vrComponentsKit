			<h3>VR Components Kit</h3>

			<p>
				This project proposes a set of high-level software components to facilitate the creation of immersive experiences.
				It focuses on solving common challenges faced by developers, such as XR controller management, dynamic
				user interface creation, scene navigation, selection and manipulation of virtual objects, and providing
				debugging tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				The solution aims to abstractthe complexity of underlying APIs like WebXR and Three.js.
				 Additionally, didactic examples are providedto functionally evaluate the modules, validate the components, and offer practical starting points for
				the development of web-based VR applications.
			</p>

			<h4>Examples</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<a href="../pages/helloVR.html"><strong>Hello VR</strong></a>
					<p>
						This is a basic example to initiate a VR scene.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../pages/navigationExample.html"><strong>Navigation example</strong></a>
					<p>
						This example evaluates the navigation module, specifically the "flight" mode and teleportation
						mechanism. It includes a scene with a colored ground plane and a 3D staircase model to test
						teleportation to different heights and verify incremental orientation changes without altering
						the user's position.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../pages/controllersExample.html"><strong>Controllers example</strong></a>
					<p>
						This example evaluates the correct functioning of the controller management module. It verifies
						the proper 3D representation of the controllers and the correct operation of event listening
						functions by printing events to the browser console.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../pages/uilVRMenuExample.html"><strong>UILVRMenu example</strong></a>
					<p>
						This example features a scene with two objects (Cube and TorusKnot) and a point light source. It
						defines a menu using the UILVrMenu class to control the rotation speeds of both objects, as well
						as the light's color and intensity. It also evaluates the menu's functionality in conjunction
						with the navigation module, ensuring that the controller's ray only activates UI actions when
						interacting with the menu, not teleportation.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../pages/htmlVRMenuExample.html"><strong>HTMLVRMenu example</strong></a>
					<p>
						This example performs the same evaluations as the UILVRMenu example, but using an HTML-based
						menu.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../pages/debugToolsExample.html"><strong>Debug Tools example</strong></a>
					<p>
						In this example, a scene is created with a 3D teapot model that changes position following a
						sine wave. A VrVarsWatcher panel displays the teapot's position, rotation, and scale vectors in
						real-time. Additionally, a VrConsole panel is included to verify the correct display of
						simulated browser console messages in VR.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../pages/grabbableObjectsExample.html"><strong>Grabbable Objects example</strong></a>
					<p>
						This example features a scene with both mobile and static objects. The first group of objects is
						configured for contact grabbing, while the second group uses "remoteGrabbing" mode. The example
						evaluates the correct functionality, especially when multiple objects are in the controller's
						ray, in which case only the closest object should be grabbed.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../pages/selectableObjectsExample.html"><strong>Selectable Objects example</strong></a>
					<p>
						In this example, a scene is created with five objects representing different materials and five
						objects representing various geometric shapes. A cylindrical pedestal in the center allows the
						user to select a material or shape, which then modifies the central object on the pedestal
						accordingly. The proposed objective was verified.
					</p>
				</li>
